## Mobile Deep Links

Mobile deep links are special links on Web pages.
They allow users to seamlessly switch into an installed application and trigger an action there.
These deep links do not start with "http://" or "https://" but use a custom schema that can be freely chosen.
For instance, it is possible to register an app to react to all links that start with "i5://".
To ensure that the schema is unique, it is also possible to use reverse DNS notation, e.g. by writing "com.i5.Toolkit://".

For more information on mobile deep links can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_deep_linking).

## Use Case

The mobile deep links can be used to quickly access functionalities and services of installed applications.
As an example, it is possible to tell the app to immediately load certain content or open a specific editor.
A common deep link that can be found on the Web is the "mailto://" schema.
If a user clicks the link, the mail client opens and automatically sets up a new mail where the receiver mail is automatically filled based on the link's content.
